# Lightning Talks | 2018-Q3 Presentations
## Rebranding I.T.
### Faith Agwang

1. Attended a woman's day conference for woman in IT, but didn't feel like she belonged
2. Think about brand definition a bit, e.g. Nike's __Just Do It__ and __Got Milk?__ which both had significant impact on product sales
3. IT is elitist - only the few fit in
4. There are far too few women in IT!  _How do we address this?_
	1. Reach out to young people
	2. Focus on making the __organisational culture__ (the work assignments, promotions, performance appraisals, etc.) more open
5. "Diverse teams lead to innovative products, resilient companies, stronger returns and a better future for all of us.", [Chloe Capital](http://chloecapital.com)
6. Change begins with each of us
	* Meet new people at work, speak to each other, invite them out for coffee
	* Assume that everyone is technical until they tell you otherwise
	* Don't assume roles based on gender (don't let the women always volunteer for note-taking or cleaning for events)
	* Don't interrupt or allow others to interrupt when the women in your team are speaking
7. __Advocate for women__ and __stand up for them__
