# 1. "Keynote: Inclusion and Transformation in Tech" | 2018-Q3 Presentations
## Christelle Martin

1. Interactive exercise to highlight how our background and experience is vastly different
2. Is IT diverse enough?
3. There is lots of information online on why diversity is important
4. Must remember that `diversity` <> `inclusivity`
  1. __Diversity__ is about inviting everyone to the event
	2. __Inclusivity__ is about who *_you_* ask to dance!
5. We make the mistake of not thinking about the softer stuff when we're busy - but we need to consciously make people feel like they belong
6. **_Imposter Syndrome_** is a big issue in testing __especially for women__
7. How do you be includive when you are busy?
  1. Include yourself and examine your internal bias
	2. Be conscious that the spaces at work do not support inclusivity
	3. Don't just focus on differences as inclusivity is just as much about how we are all similar (common ground)
	4. **Up your own awareness** - any privilige or experience that you have comes with the responsibility to give back
