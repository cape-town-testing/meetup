## ~5~ 2 Things I Love About Agile
### Bee Sharwood

1. Meant to be "5 Things I Love About Agile" but almost everything boiled down to the agile values
2. In the end, there were 2 things that I truly love about agile
	1. Focus on reality
		* Where you are going; where you are
		* Also on where you **_are not_**!  Question your assumptions!
		* Must apply our problem-solving abilities, our __far-out__ thinking even to problems that we haven't thought of yet
	2. Focus on people
		* People are beautiful, frustrating, strange and wonderful!
		* Favourite agile value is _Individuals and interactions over processes and tools_ but Scrum __will not__ get your team talking / communicating
		* Scrum __will not__ solve your problems if you aren't communicating with each other (_it may make your problems worse_)
3. You have to start talking to one another!
4. Find common ground through sharing experiences
5. __Connect__ and find strength in our differences
