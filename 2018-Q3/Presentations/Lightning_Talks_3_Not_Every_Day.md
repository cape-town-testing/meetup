## Not every day is a bad day
### Nicol Vojacek

1. Nicol watched videos about women and transformation as inspiration for this talk, but got very angry at what she saw
2. In 2018, only 13 % of STEM graduates are women
3. Nicol was the 2nd female engineer at her current employer when she joined 2 years ago
	*... She still is!
4. Being a woman doesn't make her different - she is not defined by her gender
	1. Her average working day is focussed on problem-solving
5. Women must not let themselves be the odd-one-out
6. We must educate ourselves, enlightening ourselves on the issues so that we can assist with transformation
7. Nicol encouraged us to get involved via the __Women in Technology Cape Town__ [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/WITCPT) or [Facebook group](https://m.facebook.com/groups/845235035620680)
