### Theme: 
Our 2018 Q3 meetup runs just two days before National Women's Day, a public holiday, which commemorates when on the same day in 1956 more than 20,000 South African women of all races staged a march on the Union Buildings in protest against the proposed amendments to the Urban Areas Act of 1950, commonly referred to as the "pass laws".

At this meetup we look at our context through the lens of diversity, transformation and women in tech. In a male-dominated industry, how best can we be allies to each other?
