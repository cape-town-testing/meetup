This talk focuses at a high level on DevOps, Cybersecurity and their relationship to one another.
Both DevOps are Cybersecurity are (still) not very well understood – even at a high level. Both are very relevant and impactful. This talk are to educate and to share Darin's own experiences with the intention of sharing knowledge that will empower the community to be better professionals.

**19h30 Talk: "La La Land - When Safety Systems Go Rogue - Sven Agnew**

In 2019, when La La Land was mistakenly announced as the Oscar winner for Best Picture, many people failed to realise 
that the very system put in place to prevent such an occurrence was what ultimately caused the worst public failing in the Academy's history.
How is it that simply adding safety to a complex system can become the very act that causes those systems to fail? 
In this talk, we will discuss a number of widely studied failures and catastrophes caused by so-called safety systems and what the implications are for modern software systems.
In particular we'll explore the dogma behind "monitor all the things" and ask the question "Does this make as safer or are we worse off than before?"
