**18h35**

**Talk: "High performing teams – the I’s, the we’s and the tech industry fallacies” (25 mins + questions)**

**Brian van Vuuren**

If high performing individuals working together rarely guarantees a high performing team, what does? And, more importantly, how can we achieve it in our own work ecosystems?

In today’s highly competitive tech industry, recruitment strategies tend towards snatching any and everyone who appears ‘high performing’ on paper, rather than finding the right fit for the vacancy. And yet, for the most part, high performing individuals put together rarely guarantee high performing teams. This talk takes a look at some trusted, research-based core elements of high performing teams and investigates how we can begin introducing them into our own work ecosystems.

**Talk: “Data migration and data warehouse testing” (25 mins + questions)**

**Francois Marais**

How do you test data migration and data warehousing applications? 
Without a purpose-built test tool detailed functional
testing in these high data volume environments is a challenge. The talk
outlines an approach to test automation for this type of application and includes a
demo of an in-house developed CLI test tool.
