# Lightning talks

### Hey YOU!

Guess you’ve heard about Lightning Talks then? The short, sharp presentations that start great conversations.
Cape Town Testing Meetup is giving you the opportunity to be one of your community’s Lightning Talkers at the next quarterly meetup event. We believe everyone has something interesting to share, and that it’s very important for our community to have a space to share and practice public speaking.
#### Here’s what you need to know
At Cape Town Testing it’s all about quality, fun and YOU! That means that you set content and time-limit for your own lightning talk. 
It could be a 3-minute flash review of a new piece of software you’ve encountered, a longer explanation of an ingenious strategy you’ve honed for dealing with a specific problem, or a even a quick 1 minute shout out to your favourite mentor and how mentoring has helped your career path. 
When it comes down to it, If it’s focused and engaging, we’re in and the rest is up to you.
Think of lightning talks as a high voltage, low stakes environment to test your ideas and your public speaking.

So, we grabbed you with that? GREAT! Here’s a more detailed need-to-know:
#### Choose your cut off time
Firstly, we’re accept talks of between 1 and 6 minutes. 
The catch is that you’ll need to tell us the length of the talk you’ll be giving _beforehand_.
This is because each person’s talk will be timed, and speakers are clapped out at the end of their nominated speaking time - no matter if they’ve finished they’re talk or not!
The clapping out isn’t meant to offend or embarrass; it’s there to keep the program flowing and build audience hype. Picture an audience with bated breath, wondering if you’ll manage to hit your point home before a thunder of palm-to-palm skin slapping erupts through the room. It’s thrilling, and it keeps the excitement UP!
While we’re on the subject of hype, there will also be a countdown timer projected to the main screen you while you speak which will slowly move through a colour gradient indicating how much time you have left - From green meaning you’re still safe, slowly to orange, and eventually red - meaning “time’s up!”. Nifty, innit? (Info bite: The app used for this was built specially for Cape Town Testing and is used as a testing tool at community events. Pretty rad!)
#### Like the scout motto: Be prepared!
Secondly, while we imagine that the adept among you can deliver a perfect impromptu presentation, we would prefer if you did some preparation.
Since this _isn’t_ meant to be a condensed version of the 20-minute presentation you prepared for that conference that one time, it would be best if you started with a new idea – just one...or maaaaybe two; you’d be surprised how short 1 to 6 minutes can be! Practiced the speech a few times! Your dog is dying to know the nifty trick you worked out to get your devs to collaborate better with you or what went wrong when your team followed an unorthodox retro action, for example! You get the point.
