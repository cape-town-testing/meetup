# Be a speaker at an upcoming event
There are 4 meetups per year, once every quarter although the dates do vary as do the host venues in the interest of keeping the community open and sharing the love. 
Generally we have been trying to have two 20ish minute sessions with the first one being non technical and the second one being - you guessed it - a little more on the technical side.
Your submission can be a straight up talk or a workshop or if you have something new and awesome you'd like to try out we're keen to hear what you've got to say!
In keeping with our alignment with the Let's Test conference; herewith are their guidelines for getting a talk accepted:

- New content over old
- Opinionated over one-size-fits-all stuff
- Challenges convention rather than agrees with established “truths”
- You want to present your own experiences from the field
- Interactive over sit-and-listen (but there’s room for both)
- You have a bit of extra crazy in your proposal
- Your proposal contributes depth (or breadth) to the community discourse
- You make us believe that you can deliver what you’re selling, regardless of whether you are well-known or a - first-timer to the conference scene
- We understand why people will be excited to attend your talk/workshop/session

You don’t need to hit all the points above, but if you don’t hit at least a couple, you’re in trouble. 
Once you have made your submission we will review it and be in contact. If we like what you've got we'll arrange a dry run at a time convenient to you.
Please submit your proposal to:  [capetowntestingmeetup@gmail.com](mailto:capetowntestingmeetup@gmail.com)
We look forward to seeing some awesome/crazy input from you!
