# 2018-Q2 Presentations

## 1. "Inclusive Design" 
### Steve Barnett @maxbarners & Nicola du Toit @sophdex

Join The Empathy Labradors (Nicola du Toit and Steve Barnett) for a journey through Inclusive Design. They talk about:

- How disability is a spectrum (and how the choices we make can put up barriers for our users)
- What exactly Inclusive Design is (and how it's not quite the same as accessibility)
- Why should we care about Inclusive Design (for ourselves and for our users)
- Some practical tips (on how to design and developer more inclusively)
- Concrete next steps (for us to do after the talk)
