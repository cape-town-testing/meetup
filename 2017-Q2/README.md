### Reviews from the community

- Submitted by **Pi Delport**:

  Thanks for the great meetup! :) I have some things I'd like to share:

  First, if you're interested in injection attacks and testing for them, you might be interested in this [compendium of  strings that may break systems](https://github.com/minimaxir/big-list-of-naughty-strings)


  Second, how many of you folks are enthusiastic about (or know of!) the concept of property-based testing? If you're not  familiar, these talks introduce the idea:

  GREAT SHOW GUYS! Really exhilarating stuff and very happy to see the human behavior are being realized behind why things   "break". See you at the next event!

  Thank you all!! I enjoyed the meetup and learnt something. See you at the next one...

  **Other Feedback solicited on the night:**

- “Liked and enjoyed the meet up. Would it be possible for more interactions in future? Finding out where the audience is  from and what they do? Getting people more comfortable with each other forming more of a community?”

- “Most notable of the latest meetup was the insightful intro into the world of pen testing, the demo / ride along / hack my Mac was a unique way of presenting the topic”

- “Topics had good variety (from strategy -> specific testing techniques); too much Q&A”

- “I really enjoyed the topic of the brains responses. It was a very interesting take on things and gave me a better way of thinking about my own test strategies. Thanks you Cape Town Test Meet up Team.”

- “Liked and enjoyed the meet up. Would it be possible for more interactions in future? Finding out where the audience is from and what they do? Getting people more comfortable with each other forming more of a community?”

- “Just loved it”

- “Good networking opportunity however there seems to be a hierarchy of who’s who in the CPT testing sphere.”

- “The first guy who spoke, I wasn’t feeling it though he raises some pertinent issues with regards to the psychology / mind set of a tester”

- “Aveshan’s team, when they spoke, it was mentioned that the dev’s do UAT. A bit concerning in that, that indicates a clear misunderstanding of UAT or the incorrect term was used to described the testing that their dev’s do. The dev’s did they that they did develop a framework that can simulate their transactions and freeze time to enable them to fast forward and go back in time. I thought that was really cool. However, I’m of the opinion that QA should own and develop the framework or at minimum be providing the dev’s with the framework specification. That’s just my opinion…”

- It was the perfect venue for the meet up and there were brilliant speakers.
