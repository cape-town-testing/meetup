1. Many struggle with burnout now.  It was first diagnosed in the 70s.  Japanese have a word for death caused by overwork or job-related exhaustion: __Karoshi__
2. __Disclaimer__: This is not medical advice.  Seek professional help if the content of this talk resonates with you
3. Medical definition - psychological state of physical and emotional exhaustion
4. May be difficult to diagnose accurately as the __symptoms are similar to depression and anxiety__
5. Keeping a mood journal is one approache for coping, but may be difficult for most men
6. Be careful of overtime as time-in-lieu is not as good plus its almost impossible to get time off during a the sprints.  Paid overtime does not recharge you
7. __Imposter Syndrome__ can be overcome with training, but the training must be relevant and not just a tax benefit to the company
8. Mentoring may help... or getting yourself a life coach
9. Focus on what is important.  An approach for this is to look at stakeholder needs and expectations
10. Look for culture fit - find common vision and purpose.  For example, ask yourself "Why are we actually doing testing?  Why is it important to the organisation?"
11. Please watch the TED videos referenced in the [presentation slides](https://github.com/cape-town-testing/meetup/blob/1f6f37a3fac700a21e512657693471caad0e87e7/2018-Q4/Presentations/Burnout.pptx?raw=true)
