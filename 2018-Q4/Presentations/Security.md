# 3. "Now that Customers are taking Security Seriously, how does it affect us?" | 2018-Q4 Presentations
## Salvin Naidoo 

1. Many try to pretend that security issues don't exist - but its okay.  Its one of those things we have to do 
2. This is not a lecture - rather hope to give people a view into what they haven't seen before
3. __Security breaches__
	1. Happens all the time - even if we don't know about it
  2. Not limited to a specific sector - different industries, different data
  3. Very different profile for attackers - using vulnerabilities that haven't been used before - chaining multiple vulnerabilities together
  4. Not only looking to sell data - but also to sell vulnerabilities
4. Customers want to know what frameworks we're using (e.g. OWASP) to protect data
	1. CSG team has had external training to kick start journey in this space 
  2. OWASP and SAMM - check definitions on wikipedia
  3. used to determine where they are right now and where they can improve - questionaires out to whole organisation to learn levels of maturity
5. CSG offer software-as-a-service, but cape town mainly operate under licensing

Security isn't just a developers job.  have scrum teams. collective ownership.

other rolses like analysis and test must also be security aware

"How can i chapion seuciry in my space"

if policy isn't explicit about how to deal with security vulnerablities - could have legislative penalties and reputational damage

legal issues - GDPR and POPI

Avoid circular discussions when speaking to people who are looking at things from conflicting angles

Check CVSS (common vulnerabilities scoring system)


in the coming years, delivery teams will have to be more security conscious in all domains (analysis dev and test)

Think about threat models - need to upskill ourselves.  Attack simulations need much upskilling


Get to tknow the toolsets - Wirshark, Kali fiddler OWASP ZAP

The course from pluralsight - hack yourself first - very useful course


Question - smaller companies won't have budget to make security a priority.  
Answer - they have a team at corporate level to address this.  Not about being perfect.  Its about being ethical.  POPI and GDPR will have to be a focus - as its law
Needs to become a part of what we're doing.  It isn't that difficult once you get started.  OWASP is a really good resource
