### [Louise Perold](https://www.linkedin.com/in/louise-perold-1947528/), House of Test 

"Do you love what you do? My guess is that because you are a member of this meetup, you are either passionate about testing or passionate about learning more about testing... but are we doing enough? What can we and should we be doing to further our craft."

#### Summary notes of this talk:
Majority of the Testers in general seem sad because of things like: 
- Manual testing 
- Working in silos (separated from the rest of the team)
- Deemed oblivious

The most important thing we can do is to connect with other people and make testing seem like a craft

Why are you a tester? (Answers from audience)
- "Like to notice when its broken"
- "Instead of just liking to break things rather focus on building something better"
- "Finding things nobody else can"
- "Making beautiful software"

Purpose.. Working in silos and seemingly being deemed oblivious creates the perception that we have purpose. But Being a Tester we need find our purpose as
a QA. By having a philosophy to strive for, we find our purpose simply by asking:
"What is the business problem we are trying to solve?"

Amazing testing is about being the person who know it can be different. The person who knows the software can be better.

Why was Lets Test started?
- Testing was always a path 
- How can you be a better tester is you are isolated.. the answer found is simply by hanging with other testers. 
Testers get to learn new stuff everyday. 
How is it possible to find testing boring considering that?
As a tester there is always something new to do and explore. Not forgetting there is always new tech to play with.

The human psychology of testing: 
- We are the voice of reason 
- As testers we need to be pro at balancing people, time, coms and communicating with teams.

What helps as a QA: 
- Attending as many conferences as possible 
- Speaking at conferences 
- By being around similar minded people (In SA we need this to be more accessible)
- As Testers we constantly need to learn and push boundaries.

Part of being a better Tester is to spread the love:
Am I the best ambassador of QA?
How about sharing passion? (You can learn by articulating your thoughts) We can share our passion in our teams and office. Break barriers with our teams. 
Volunteer at the Cape Town Testers Meetup

Share as a QA. We can all a mentor to QA's that are not aware. We can share experience and learning with each other. Share the love with each other.




## 2. "Visual Regression using the new Headless Chrome browser" 
![MAKE QUALITY FRIENDS, MAKE QUALITY SOFTWARE](https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/9/d/3/highres_468670707.jpeg)
### [Donovan Graham](https://www.linkedin.com/in/donovangraham/)

Don will be taking us through the basic intricacies of visual regression, which business or testing problems this kind of tooling does or doesn't solve, what chrome headless is and why it's pretty darn cool!

Start playing with visual regression by setting up our demo, [the project is available on our meetup GitHub page, here](https://github.com/cape-town-testing/tooling/tree/master/visual-regression).

#### Presentation video: _Coming soon!_

####  [Presentation slides](Automate_Visual_Regression.ppt)

#### Summary notes of this talk:
Visual regression is not the ability to identify issues. Its more to identify what is most correct. 
If a test fails, we either reject or accept it. 
If we reject it, we need to define a new baseline.

Unit testing is the cheapest form of testing. 
Although manual testing is the most expensive, it has a different set of values. The value of manual testing is infinitely higher than that of unit testing.
