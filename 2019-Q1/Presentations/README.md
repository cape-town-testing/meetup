# 2019-Q1 Presentations

## 1 “Local communities are an endless source of inspirational testing ideas, perspective & support. At this session you’ll be inspired to tap into and level-up your involvement in your local meetup.”

Advance your testing by connecting with your peers! An energized local testing community is an amazing platform for sharing wild and wacky testing philosophies that you would never have thought of. 
In talk you’ll hear about how you can fire-up and tap into your local testing community for an endless source of inspirational testing ideas...and meaningful community connection!
Just over two years ago I founded and started running my local meetup. Each quarter, the meetup runs events, to a consistent crowd of 60+ software professionals, that have been better described as ‘mini-conferences’ due to the range of out-of-the-box program activities to get involved in.
Through my stories of the successes and failures experienced in running the meetup, you’ll also learn about:
* The often-understated benefits (for you...and your community) of connecting and contributing to your local testing community.
* The ridiculously wide spectrum of activities to choose from to contribute to your community (Don’t fret, shy ones - presenting is just one of countless ways to add value!).
* How to harness the heuristic we use to keep our audience engaged and coming back for more: The four keys to fun being Friendship, Novelty, Challenge and Meaning.  

Join me to find out what you’re missing out on in your own backyard!
