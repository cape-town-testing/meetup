# 1 “Local communities are an endless source of inspirational testing ideas, perspective & support. At this session you’ll be inspired to tap into and level-up your involvement in your local meetup.”

* The term "Testers" is used referring to people in the testing role, but also includes allies of testing
* Everyone asked to stand up.  If its true, put your hand out.  Sit down if you don't care
	* Have you ever been to a Cape Town Testing meetup event
	* Do you have knowledge of the community slack workspace?
	* Do you have knowledge of our casual monthly hangouts for the ocmmunity

* Introduced his dad.  Matt fell down some stairs and broke a few ribs.  Matt's dad has also broken a few ribs on bike trips (dangerous trips - adventure riding)
* Cool father and son trips.... have the same bikes so that they can share tools and parts
* Take cheesy photos
* When Matt got his first bike, he didn't know the controls, etc.  He felt quite alone
* But his dad and brother helped him... they were his community
* Powersliding is going around a corner as quick as possible
* Matt is really slow in corners
* He saw how others take corners really quicky using powersliding
* He learned from his community
* When he started in testing, he was a finance major
* He started getting bored and he plateaued
* The TedTalk from Eduardo talks about the learning zone - he didn't deliberatily spend time in the learning zone
* He got this by mistake at Lets Test where he was inspired - it made him think about why he is a testers
* He thought about it whilst making this talk - testing is a black sheep role... nobody expects you to be a valuable member of the team
* I will learn to swim... but by the end of it, you won't be able to do without
* After lets test, he couldn't wait to go the next one.  He wanted to bring the feeling home... and that is why he started Meetup
* Refers to Simon Sinek - people don't buy what you do, they buy WHY you do it
* CTTM exists to fight for you - to keep you sharp
* Make testers in Cape Town rpoud to be testers and create a strong bond between them
* Tester pride - learn from conversations around you what you do know and what you don't know... so you can learn more
* Testing doesn't discriminate against ideas
* Also an opportunity to mentor and learn
* The engagement is not high enough - take if if you want it
* Guiding light:  Make quality friends and make quality software - we can't be proud of this community unless we are good at what we do
* CTTM has a code of conduct
* Consists of Planners, the community and everyone else.  You are only a community member when on Slack - thats how we keep in contact.  Slack is how we pull the community into the planning zone
* The hussling behind the scenes needs to be more visible
* WHAT:
	* Venue, food, drinks
	* But lots of things to get involved with - even just replying and sharing cool articles on slack
	* Giving a talk is also one of the things
* Game designer heuristic - cater for each quadrant
	* Socialiser, Achiever, Philanthopist, Free Spirit
* As people leave, asked to put peoples ideas down so we can include it in the next meetup
* Talked about WHY, HOW, WHAT.... now what!?
* Be honest - what is holding you back from getting involved?
* Level up your journey... join slack... but do more... connect in any way that you can
* What have we learned?
	* Don't fracture ribs
	* Community connection
	* Crowd source 4 keys 2 fun meetup
