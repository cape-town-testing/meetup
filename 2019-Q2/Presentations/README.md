# 2019-Q2 Presentations

## 1 Python developer; Heather Williams talks to us about the journey she has been on  

### Heather Williams [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/heatherjwilliams/), [Personal website](https://heatherjw.github.io/)
A developers perspective on the big wide world of testing in the wild. Heather walks us through all the things she has learned about testing whilst working at Siyavula Education, from TDD and BDD to integration testing and the struggle of deciding if you should test the test. An engaging and insightful perspective of why we test, regardless of who is doing the testing.

## 2 "Testing Jest"

### Blanche Carstens & Calvin Moore
Our front end is written in JavaScript & React, which is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Using Jest was an obvious testing choice for us, as Jest is an open source library used for testing JavaScript code & React applications. It requires zero configuration which meant testing sooner & delivering faster. Ideal for our microservices architecture. Jest is composed of many other packages like jest-snapshot, jest-validate etc, which makes Jest more than just a test runner with a built in assertion library. We used Jest Snapshot to test our UI components which works by taking a screenshot & compares it to a stored, reference image. The test fails if the two images do not match. We later realised that Jest Snapshot can be used for most JavaScript types including API responses, arrays, objects strings etc & not only UI components. If you are interested in learning more about Jest & Snapshot testing come join us.
