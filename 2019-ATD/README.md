* Summary notes taken during the talk:

`Origin of Cape Town Testing Meetup`
```
	* Started out in finance and moved to IT and got into testing
	* Went to Let's Test after first year as a tester
	* Realised there was a pride and sense of community that came to being a testing
	* Wanted to be a tester because it was a black sheep role.
	* Wanted to bring a sense of identity and purpose to testing in local town
	* Got inspired to create a meetup and take the learning and conference experience to people in community 
	* Started in Feb 2017 and since then have hosted one each quarter
	* Each meetup has a video, talks, prizes, games and take notes from each session to share with others
	* Started at local company but wanted to share it with other companies in the area and use it as a form of marketing and promotion from other companies 
	* Ideas used: Talks, Games, Social Activities
```
Benefits of a meetup - Why should you do it
```
        * Occur more frequently than a conference 
	* Keep the energy and learning from a conference moving forward on a regular basis`

	1. Create a community
	* Create a sense of community and allow others to find purpose in their career
	* Used a platform like Slack to share information with others and allow testers to talk to each other
	* Find ways for further social engagement and learning
	* Al's more frequent meet upd

	2. Grow testing craft
	* Run worship both technically and through soft skills to help grow the overall eating skills in the community 

	3. Create Tester Identity
	* Allow testers to feel proud of who they are

	4. Grow Confidence
	* Help to grow confidence in both skills and as speakers to use
	* As speakers, take your messages to a smaller audience 

	5. A Safe Space to Develop and Share
	* Create a safe environment for learning without judgement in the testing community
```
Mistakes made
	```
        * Initial motto was too long and people didn't connect with it
	* Eventually settled on: Make Quality Friends and make Quality software`
	```
Things to help your community grow 
	
	1. For Us By Us
	* Get others involved 
	* Work with local volunteers to make it happen. Engage the other testers in the community and get them invested and involved. This helps them to get it to grow. 

	2. Value Proposition
	* Its not just about testers, but also an opportunity for other companies in the community to sponsor and host events to gain publicity as well

	3. Many ways to add value 
	* Doesn't need to take a lot of time. Encouraging others to just use 30min every week or month is enough to start them promoting and getting engaged.
	* Volunteers can do things like communication, marketing, signing ups, organising games and activities, talk, find venues, etc. 

	4. Blow Minds
	* Find talks and inspiring ideas to share with others and get them interested
	* Get people to share lessons, ideas and workshops
